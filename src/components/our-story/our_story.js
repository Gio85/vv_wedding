          A slightly different story to most, but this is our unique one. It all begun back in 2013, in fair London we set our scene, in the fancy
          neighbourhood of South Kensington. Some said it was destiny, some said it was love but we like to call it “magic”.
        </p>
        <p className="storyParagraph">
          It was only another noisy day in the Italian restaurant, Carluccios, but that day Vincenzo and Vera’s life was about to change.
        </p>
        <p className="storyParagraph">
          The story of two star-crossed lovers was about to start. The crazy Vincenzo, was making his living as a barista, but London had far more
          challenges for him.
        </p>
        <p className="storyParagraph">
          He did not know that the providence was preserving him something special and one day, Vera burnished as a Brightstar, "she doth teach the
          torches to burn bright!".
        </p>
        <p className="storyParagraph">
          Vincenzo couldn’t stand such beauty and instantly he realised that his heart did not know love until now. But once again the challenge was
          in every morning and the language gave him a warning.
        </p>
        <p className="storyParagraph">
          The first attempts from the Italian chap were, actually, very crap, but soon Vera decided to start. Beauty too rich for use, for Earth too
          dear. Every day he tried.
          <p className="storyParagraph">
            Written notes and broken verse. The two lovers engaged in a mix of Italo-Portu-Spanish language and a whole lot of hand gestures. The
            destiny finally worked in their favour.
          </p>

        <p className="storyParagraph">
          Fast forward 6 years later, off they go to embark in yet another adventure – And live the rest of their lives together!
