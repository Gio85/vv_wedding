        <br />
        <br />
        <p className="storyParagraph">It all begun back in 2013, in fair London we set our scene,</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph">in the fancy neighbourhood of South Kensington.</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph">Some said it was destiny, some said it was love </p>
        <p className="storyParagraph"> but we like to call it “magic”.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className="storyParagraph">It was only another noisy day in the Italian restaurant Carluccios,</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph"> but that day Vincenzo and Vera’s life was about to change.</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph">The story of two star-crossed lovers was about to start.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className="storyParagraph">The crazy Vincenzo, was making his living as a barista,</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph">but London had far more challenges for him.</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph">He did not know that the providence </p>
        <p className="storyParagraph">was preserving him something special and one day,</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph"> Vera burnished as a Brightstar,</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph">“she doth teach the torches to burn bright!”.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className="storyParagraph">Vincenzo couldn’t stand such beauty and instantly</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph">he realised that his heart did not know love until now.</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph">But once again the challenge was in every morning</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph"> and the language gave him a warning.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className="storyParagraph">The first attempts from the Italian chap were, actually, very crap,</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph"> but soon Vera decided to start.</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph"> Beauty too rich for use, for Earth too dear.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className="storyParagraph"> Every day he tried.</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph">Written notes and broken verse. </p>
        <p className="storyParagraph"> The two lovers engaged in a mix of Italo-Portu-Spanish language</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph"> and a whole lot of hand gestures.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className="storyParagraph">The destiny finally worked in their favour.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p className="storyParagraph">Fast forward 6 years later, off they go to embark in yet another adventure</p>
        <p className="storyParagraph"> and live the rest of their lives together!</p>
